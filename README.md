# Algorithms
This repository will help to understand the algorithms and data structures in a programmatic manner.

**Growth of functions:**
 * O(1) - Value is 1
 * log n(also log<sub>2</sub>n) - Value is 3.332.
 * n - Value is 10
 * nlogn - Value is 33.2
 * n<sup>2</sup> - Value is 100 
 * 2<sup>n</sup> - Value is 1024
 * n! - 10! Value is 3million
