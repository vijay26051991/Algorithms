# Algorithms
This repository will help to understand the algorithms and data structures in a programmatic manner.

**Growth of functions:**
 * O(1) *Add an element to an array*
 * log n(also log<sub>2</sub>n) - *Binary search(Divide and conquer method)*
 * n - *Linear search*
 * n logn - *Quick sort*
 * n<sup>2</sup> - *Bubble sort*
 * 2<sup>n</sup> - Value is 1024 
 * n! - 10! Value is 3million
